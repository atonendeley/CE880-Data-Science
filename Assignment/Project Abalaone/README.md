There are two sections for this assignment Part 1 and Part 2
CE880 Abalone Project Assignment 06012022 v2 .ipynb Part 1
CE880 Abalone Project Assignment 06012022 v2.1.ipynb Part 2
Part 1 starts with importing the modules, then the profile of the dataet was analysed using profile report and exploratory data analysis.
Next hot encoding was deployed on the data set before splitting the data.
Next was multi linear regression carried out on the dataset, using regularisation of multilinear regression.
Lasso regression, Ridge Regression and decision tree based model.
Light GBM  was also deployed
Finally a compilation of all the models was undetaken showing the final result.
Hyparameter optimisation using random search for regression and classification.

Part 2 Analysis of Regression and Classification 
CE880 Abalone Project Assignment 06012022 v2.1.ipynb Part 2
Multlayer Perceptron (MLP) combined Neural Network Model for Classification and Regression based on predicting both numeric and class label

It starts with importing the modules, then the profile of the dataet was analysed using profile report and exploratory data analysis.
Next hot encoding was deployed on the data set before splitting the data.
Input features were shown with the hiidden layer and actvation functions
Regression output 
Classification output 
The model was defined
The model was complied using keras
The graph of the model (Visualisation) was plotted to show both the classification and regression.
The training of the data showing the number of epochs and batch size was displayed.
Culminating on the prediction on the test data, the mean absolute error and acccuracy score was shown.
