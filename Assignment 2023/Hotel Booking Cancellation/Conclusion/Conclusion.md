# Conclusion
* Overall the Decision Tree model performs better on the dataset.
* Looking at important variables based on p-values in Logistic regression and feature importance in the Decision Tree model
* Lead Time, Number of special requests, Average price per room are important in both model

#### From the Logistic Regression model we observe that Lead Time, and Average price per room have a positive relation with bookings getting canclled. And the number of special requests has negative relation with bookings getting cancelled.

* The hotel can take the following actions for the customers who have booked more than 151 days in advance:
* Set up a system that can send a prompt (like an automated email or app notification) to the customers 90 days prior to arrival date asking them to re - confirm their booking, with any changes they would like to make in their bookings.
* Remind guests about imminent deadlines 1 month before the date of their arrival.

#### The response from customers will help the hotel make decisions and enough time to either re-sell the room or make preparations to accommodate request from the customers.

* Stricter cancellation policies can be adopted by the hotel.
* The bookings where the average price per room is high, and there were special requests associated should not get a full refund as the loss of resources will be high in these cases.
* Ideally the cancellation policies should be consistent across all market segments but as noticed in our analysis high percentage of bookings done online are cancelled. The booking cancelled online should yield less percentage of refund to the customers.
* The refunds, cancellation fee should be highlighted on the website/app before a customer confirms their booking to safeguard their interest.
 #### Recommendation from insights
*	From the analysis it shows that bookings, where the total length of stay was more than 5 days, had a higher chance of getting cancelled. The hotel can restrict the duration of booking up to 5 days only with an option for customers to book an extension if they are willing to extend their stay. Such restrictions can be a good strategy for the hotel to generate additional revenue and can be relaxed for certain market segments (like Corporate and Aviation) such that it does not hamper their experience with the hotel.
*	During December and January ratio of cancellation to non-cancellation is low. Customers might travel to celebrate Christmas and New Year. The hotel should ensure that they have adequate human resources available to cater for the needs of their guests.
* October and September saw the highest number of bookings but also high number of cancellations. This should be investigated further by the hotel.

#### Improving the experience of repeated customers.
* A loyal guest is usually more profitable for the business because they are more familiar with offerings from the hotel they have visited before.
* Attracting new customers is tedious and costs more, when compared to a repeat guest.
* A loyalty program that offers - special discounts, access to services in hotels, etc for these customers can help in improving their experience.
