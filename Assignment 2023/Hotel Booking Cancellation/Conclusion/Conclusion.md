# Conclusion
* Overall the Decision Tree model performs better on the dataset.
* Looking at important variables based on p-values in Logistic regression and feature importance in the Decision Tree model
* Lead Time, Number of special requests, Average price per room are important in both model
* Insights that can be deduced from the Logistic Regression model, Lead Time, and Average price per room have a positive relation with cancelled bookings. Additionally the number of special requests has a negative relationship with bookings being cancelled.


The study demonstrated the effectiveness of logistic regression and decision trees in predicting hotel booking cancellations.
* Both models achieved good predictive performance, with the decision tree model improving after pruning. 
* The study's findings can help hotels identify the most significant predictors of cancellations and take preventive measures to reduce losses.
