#### Summary Performance of the Model

* Analysis to predict whether a booking will be cancelled or not from the information provided.

* F1 Score will be used as the performance metric for the model on the following basis:

* If we predict that a booking will not be cancelled and the booking gets cancelled, then the hotel will lose resources and will have to bear additional costs from the distribution channels. 

* If we predict that a booking will get cancelled and the booking does not the hotel might not be able to provide satisfactory services to the customer on the assumption that the booking will be cancelled. This might be detrimental to the brandâ€™s equity, based on recognition of the brand, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction.

* F1 score will minimise both false positives and false negatives.

* Indication from the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models shows the most significant predictors of booking status are:

* Lead Time

* Number of special requests

* Average price per room
